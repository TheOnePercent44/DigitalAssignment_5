<h2>Plague-ify</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a zombie, and you must convert humans into more zombies so your ravenous piles of corpses can build as high as the tallest skyscrapers.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Critical Thinking and Tool Application skill development. The player should feel tested to make use of the zombies they have in order to reach higher platforms in innovative ways.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer, Zombie
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Arrow Keys to move. Holding Spacebar initiates "Pile" mode. When in Pile mode, tap left or right to send the zombie minions to the nearest platform in that direction, wherein they will proceed to pile up on top of each other, allowing you to climb up (run over to them using left or right, whichever you chose, and then press and hold up to climb. Do NOT let go of spacebar when climbing or the stack will crumble!).

Note: You CAN let go of spacebar, and in the current bugged build you will find interesting results. Feel free to play with it. The current stage can be "cleared" without bugs, but to achieve "ultra clear" (the highest peak on the map) you may need to get creative.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Wanted to try limiting the player's mobility to a resource. This way, with some fine-tuning of the mechanic details, the player should be able to leave the area to acquire more zombies, then return when they can build a larger ladder. Zombies can sometimes be seperated from the player too, originally a glitch, but potentially a future feature, allowing players to move zombies apart from themselves in a sort of "all-shift" fashion.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Blocks
Zombie Teamwork Building!
Ladders!
More Blocks!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are the beginning of the zombie apocalypse. Spread the plague to all the heights!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
See Setting/Premise
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Resource Management and Platform/Puzzler players
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
1-4 minutes, there isn't a finished level really, just a small obstacle course to view the mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Glitch Innovation at present
</li>

<li><strong>Estimated Schedule:</strong>
Came along better than I expected given that I only actually put in probably 6 hours or less. Of course a final version probably wouldn't be composed of blocks (though I d oenjoy simplistic graphics like that, and not only because they require no artistic stress on my part), and you would need a full set of levels. Those can be worked on pretty easily once the mechanic is fine tuned. Current problem with backtracking, since the zombies only go to a ledge they can't move over. Will need to implement stronger control over the pile mode so that they can ladder in arbitrary locations. Estimated time to finish mechanics: 3-6 weeks. Art Assets and Animations: You'd need to ask an artist/animator, cause bump that, I'm never touching art again. Level design and construction: Depends on the quantity and complexity, anywhere from 4-16 weeks after mechanics are complete, independently of the artwork.

<li><strong>Team:</strong>
Anthony Sermania: Lead Everything
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Red, Purple, Yellow and Green blocks made with Gimp and assembled in Tiled as necessary (just the green ones really, the rest were used as sprites)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Thomas was alone; inspiration for the art of all future prototypes from me. Seriously, play it. Cool game.
